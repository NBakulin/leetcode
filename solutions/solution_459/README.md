# [459. Repeated Substring Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-substring-pattern/description/)

## Problem Description

Given a string `s`, check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together.


Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abab"
Output: true
Explanation: It is the substring "ab" twice.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "aba"
Output: false
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "abcabcabcabc"
Output: true
Explanation: It is the substring "abc" four times or the substring "abcabc" twice.
```

Constraints:

* `1 <= s.length <= 104`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Solution Properties
* `SC = O(k)`
* `TC = O(n * âˆšn)`
* Runtime ~ 8 ms (`beats ~93%`)
* Memory ~ 44 mb (`beats ~32%`)
